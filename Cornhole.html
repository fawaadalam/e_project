                <p>Set up your board on a flat surface.</p>

                <p>The distance you stand away from the board is really up to you. The official competition distance is 8.2 metres (27 ft) but a good social distance is 6 metres (20 ft).</p>
                <br>
                <p>We recommend being a little closer when you first start out or have younger or older players.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To work out your distance, just stride it out. A good stride is a metre but if you have short legs it's perhaps only half a metre.</p>

                    <li>Use a line or a marker (real or imaginary) that the players stand behind.</li>
                    <li>A foot over the line is a foot fault, that throw doesn't get points and the bag is removed from play.</li>
                    <li>Throws are alternate – one player throws one bag and then the next player throws one bag.</li>
                    <li>Once each player has thrown all four of their bags – that's a round and you record your score.</li>

                    <li>If a bag touches the ground that is zero points.</li>

                    The lower score gets taken off the higher score and the player with the higher score gets those points.

                    <li>Player A has 5 points and Player B has 9 points. 9 – 5 = 4.</li>
                    <li>Player B gets 4 points for the round</li>

                If no points are scored, the team who went first in the previous round throws first again.</p>

                    That's a bean bag that is hanging off the side of the board or half way through the hole. A hanger is 1 point.</p>
