            <ul>
                <li>All players roll a die with the highest roll starting the game. Play continues clockwise</li>
                <li>Fill in the top column of the scorecard with players' names</li>
                <li>For each turn a player has up to three rolls to achieve their desired outcome</li>
                <li>Roll your dice with the intent of scoring higher than your opponents at the end of the game</li>
                <li>Each turn and roll you must decide what combo you are after</li>
                <li>After each turn, the player must fill one entry on their score card</li>
                <li>Play continues until each player has filled all their boxes for 13 rounds</li>
                <li>You can fill the boxes in any order that you like but ensure that only one box is filled per round. The only exception is if you roll a Bonus Yankee</li>

                The score is the combination you roll times the number (i.e. if three 4's roll you get up the sum of the three 4's plus their value) but you must circle appropriate box.

            <p class="example">
                Example: If you have rolled five 5's and you can use up the following combinations after your first roll you would score:
